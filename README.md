# NodeMailer
NodeMailer is a nodejs application using nodemailer module. It can sent email to people without opening your mailbox.

Note:
1. Since it requires users email account and password, you have to enter your email and password to run this code(I have left the space blank.Email and password should be entered in router/form.js file at line 13 and 14, and the receipient address at line 19.)
2. While creating the server use 'npm start' in your command prompt.
3. If you are not a regular node js user , make sure to install all the required modules before running the application. 
4. The important part of the code is in app.js file and in the router folder(form.js and index.js).
5. You must be logged in from your into the gmail account simultaneously.
